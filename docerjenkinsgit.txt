docker login -> login to the docker hup.
dockerhub is docker repogitory where we can push the images. intially we need to create account in dockerhub. 
docker images -> will give all the images.

===============================================


git status -> gives commit status of files
git fetch -> downloads new data from remote repogitory .does not inegrate any of the new data into your working files
             git fetch can be done any time to update the remote tracking branches
git pull -> updates current head branch with latest chanes from the remote server.it downloads new data and 			      integrates withurrent working files .it tries to merge remote changes with your local files.
git stash -> when we want to switch to another brabch to work on something else but you dont want to commit the changes to your]
             unfinished work then we use 'git stash' . it takes your modfied trcked files and save it on a stack of unfinished
			 changes that you can reapply at any time. 
CI-> continously commit the code.
Con-delevery -> making the code available for deployment
pipeline:-> user defined model of a CD pipeline. pipeline's code defines entiere build process, that includes building ,testing,
and delevering a application.

NODE: A machine which is part of jenkins environment capable of executing a pipeline
step: a single task that tells jenkins what to do at a perticular time.


stage: difines a concesptually distinct sebsest of tasks performed through the entire pipeline(build ,test,deploye)

-> There are two types of pipelines in jenkins. 1. scripted pipeline 2. declarative

scripted pipeline : its based on groovy script as their domain specific languange .one or more node blocks does the core work
through out the entire pipeline.

-> what are the ways in which a build can be scheduled/run in jenkins.
 1. by  sourch code management commits
 2.after completion of other build
 3.schedule to run at spcified time
 4.manual build request.
 
->Two ways to restart jenkins manually. 
 1. (jenkins_url)/restart -> forces a restart without waiting for build to complete
 2. (jenkins_url)/safeRestart -> allows all runnig builds to complete before restart
