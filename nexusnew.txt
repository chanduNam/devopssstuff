install nexus using below URL.
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citb30/nexus/master/install.sh |bash

we will have two majar repogitories.
1. maven-release(used in production)
2. maven-snapshot(used in dev env)

===========================
below changes needs to done in pom.xml

<distributionManagement>
        <repository>
            <id>deployment</id>
            <name>Releases</name>
            <url>http://nexus:8081/repository/student-releases/</url>
        </repository>
        <snapshotRepository>
            <id>deployment</id>
            <name>Snapshots</name>
            <url>http://nexus:8081/repository/student-snapshots/</url>
        </snapshotRepository>
    </distributionManagement>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
to upload the code to nexus repogitory we have update the credentials in setting.ml(in jenkins

1.cp /etc/maven/settings.xml 

 <server>
      <id>deployment</id> --> id is pom.xml id
      <username>admin</username>  -> nexus username
      <password>admin123/password> --> nexus password
    </server>

	
	
	  ===================================
change version i.e snapshot /release

	   <groupId>com.srk</groupId>
        <artifactId>studentapi</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.3-SNAPSHOT</version> ->    if we want release update RELEASE in version tag.
        <packaging>war</packaging>
exple:

		<groupId>com.srk</groupId>
        <artifactId>studentapi</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.3-RELEASE</version>

NOTE:

whenever sprints starts in jira

1. create a feature branch in GIT
2. developers own stories and create theier own branches from feature branch and start workin on it.
3. they merge the code into feature branch.
4. end of the sprint a pull request will be raised to merge the code from release(feature branch) branch to master branch

 In jenkins we will have one job for master branch to pull the code.
 but every time new feature branch comes we have to create new pipeline job


Use below command to override release/snapshot version

mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
and run --> mvn deploy -> to create the snapshot/release
